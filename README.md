=> to do everything from accessing your spreadsheet, filling up the database and sending emails

# -email_bulk_send-
 This program sends emails in bulk from a google spreadsheet database.
 You can customize what spreadsheet database you take the emails from
 using the prompts at launch. If this doesn't work, look out for copy/paste
 errors you could have done and try again. If this still doesn't work, 
 send me a message on slack @rigomont.J or via email at rigomontj@gmail.com
